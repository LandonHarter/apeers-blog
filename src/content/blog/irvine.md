APEERS is going **“Beyond the Stars”!**

At least, that’s what the theme of our latest event was.

Seventy students came together for an **eleven-hour hackathon** hosted by **APEERS Irvine** in Southern California. The event marked the Irvine chapter’s first and was organized by chapter director Christopher Lee and his teammates Haris Faruqi and Carlos Ramirez.

The event featured **over $20,000 in prizes** as well as free food, workshops, and merchandise. Of course, following suite with our fundamental mission of making education more accessible, the event was completely free for all participants.

The team was thrilled to see students exploring different projects that related to the theme. From **websites of the universe to an interactive VR simulation** on set, the diversity and creativity of the projects was truly inspiring.

Things really got competitive when the group switched gears for a cup-stacking contest ;)

The event also featured workshops for **Sprig** and **Blot**, which are open-source projects hosted by **Hack Club**.

APEERS is just getting started with a **series of international events** just like this one! We have big plans for the summer, including **hackathons in Romania and Rwanda** as well as several virtual events. If you are interested in getting involved or leading a chapter yourself, stay tuned and check out the **Chapters** page.
